          not we hold or process any of your personal information (by emailing{" "}
          <a href="mailto:privacy@wiley.com">privacy@wiley.com</a>). In your
          written request, you may:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Request that we provide you with details of your personal
            information that we process, the purpose for which it is processed,
            the recipients of such information, the existence of any automated
            decision making involving your personal information, and what
            transfer safeguards we have in place;

          <li>
            Request that we rectify any errors in your personal information;

          <li>
            Request that we delete your personal information if our continued
            processing of such information is not justified;
          </li>
          <li>
            Request that we transfer your personal information to a third party;
          </li>
          <li>
            Object to automated decision-making and profiling based on
            legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public
            interest (in which event the processing will cease except where
            there are compelling legitimate grounds, such as when the processing
            is necessary for the performance of a contract between us);
          </li>
          <li>Object to direct marketing from us; and</li>
          <li>
            Object to processing for purposes of scientific, historical research
            and statistics.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where applicable under your local laws, we will not use your personal
          information for marketing purposes, nor disclose your information to
          any third parties, unless we have your prior consent, which we will
          seek before collecting your personal information. You can exercise
          your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the
          consent forms we use when collecting your personal information. If at
          any point you wish to review or change your preferences you can use
          the “opt-out” or unsubscribe mechanism or other means provided within
          the communications that you receive from us. Note that you may still
          receive transactional communications from Wiley. For queries, please

          Additional Information Regarding Children’s Privacy
        </h4>
        <p>
          If we ask a child age 13 or under to provide us with certain
          information such as the child’s full name, home address, email
          address, telephone number, age information or any other information
          that would allow someone to identify or contact the child, we ask for
          a parent or guardian’s consent for a child to provide that
          information. We may use the parent’s email address to seek the
          parent’s consent or notify the parent of his/her child’s online
          activities. We do not share the children’s information with outside
          third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy for their own marketing
          purposes. If you would like to review any personal information that we
          have collected online from your child, have this information deleted
          from our active servers, and/or request that there be no further
          collection or use of your child’s information or if you have questions
          about these information practices, you may contact us at{" "}
